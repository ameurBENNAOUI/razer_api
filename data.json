Such repeatable, off-the-shelf elements span areas of structures, enabling fast building and finishing operations. Made out of concrete or cement, blocks can be solid or hollow, the latter enabling lightweight construction. Similar paving blocks and cladding can span very large areas. Due to lead-time and on-site storage considerations of these materials, mainly for blocks and bricks, estimating their quantities accurately is paramount.\n\nThe area needed for these modular elements has to be calculated first. These areas can be calculated by subtracting the areas of openings from the overall extent, as shown in Figure 1. There is also material wastage involved, requiring more material than that is indicated by area calculations alone, e.g. 5% wastage area-wise. This area is useful for quantity surveyors, buyers, and site engineers.\n\nOnce the area required is known, based on the height and width of concrete blocks, bricks, paving stones, or cladding panels, the area covered by a modular element can be estimated. The two values lead to the calculation of the number of blocks or panels required. Usually these elements come in a pack and knowing the number of units in a pack, the packs that need to be ordered can also be evaluated. This information is again sought by the site team and the buyer.\n\nA module, called Blockwork, Cladding, and Paving within GroundApp helps site personnel and the buyer easily perform this calculation. It allows the user to calculate calculate overall area, areas for openings, and then the net area, based on the wastage input by the user. Then it allows the user to choose element type (e.g. block or bricks), allowing the calculation of number of units needed. Moreover, the user can input the amount of units in a pack to calculate the amount of packs needed for the job.\n\nFigure 2 depicts a cavity wall, where facing bricks, substructure blockwork, and insulation are all made out of repeating module structures. For such a wall, the Blockwork, Cladding, and Paving module has the dimensions of bricks and blocks, leading to the quantity calculations and an estimation of their respective packs. Similarly insulation also consists of a number of panels. The Blockwork, Cladding, and Paving module also permits definition of custom element sizes, and this feature can be used to define the insulation panel size, and based on the total area of insulation required, evaluates the panel numbers."}, {"ner": "NSW CONTRACTOR LICENCE\nComsec Sydney Training Centre provides:\n*** RPL Qualifications - Convert your experience into Certificate III & IV such as: Builder, Glass and Glazing, Stonemason, Welding, Gyprock,See More Bricklaying, Painting, Waterproofing, Carpentry, Concrete, Plumbing, Joinery, Painting, Tiling, Stonmasonry, Landscaping, Carpentry and Joinery, Waterproofing, Handyman,...\nSHORT COURSE TRAINING:\n1.

We do not take interest in why you offer Umbrella PAYE or indeed any Umbrella pay method instead of CIS. We do not take interest in why you can't answer the phone when we call about the jobs you've given us.\n\nTo the point, if you can't put up job ads that meet our spec THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE A RECRUITER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE DOING WITH ANY INTEGRITY. YOU SHOULD EXERCISE THE COURAGE TO FACE THE RAINS OF THE OPEN MARKET PLACE INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND A PHONE AND DECEPTIVE JOB ADS.\n\nThere is a silver lining however, if you adapt your practices and this goes noticed by us, then we will embrace you into the fold as a reputable, upstanding recruiter. Your ads, as opposed to receiving critique, will receive endorsement. You will find workers who are happy and confident in their position and thus can take on the hardships of the jobs you provide, you will out compete your competitors and you can enjoy a fruitful relationship with our movement and the promise it holds.\n\nNow I say this: go now, take a good hard look at your company, your processes, your clients, your systems, your staff and ask yourself \"AM I READY TO ADAPT AND TURN THIS INTO AN HONEST BUSINESS\".\n\nI sincerely hope you are.\nSign our petition to Ban Umbrella from the industry here: https://bit.ly/3nnGMVl\nJoin our Union Movement here: https://bit.ly/3tzd1mK\n#notoumbrellapaye\nTom Finnis\n\nP.S.

All I can say, is the hissesSee More of snakes is getting louder but so is the beat of our drums.\n\nSince we began this journey just over 3 weeks ago, we have seen over 1300 people join our group, another 1000 have been invited, accepted and are awaiting approval. We have also seen over 6200 signatures for our petition to ban/regulate Umbrella companies/processes. May I say, this has largely been drawn from the Facebook Construction job groups ALONE.\n\nA tremendous gain, however it has not been without the exchange of crossfire. Personally, I have been on the receiving end of speculation, insults, assumptions and comments. I have had people directly message me huge paragraphs and then delete them before I have properly opened them. I have had people contact me, looking to offer information, advice, ask questions, only to see that their agenda is slippery and slimy.\n\nNot only this, my account was hacked about a week ago by someone in England. Fortunately, Facebooks' security protocols put a stop to this. My account was then locked, again, I was able to regain control of it, then just 2 days ago, my account was put under \"review\" by Facebook. Now I don't believe this is Facebooks' fault, I believe these actions were the result of lobbyists' manipulation of Facebooks \"report\" features online. For 24hrs, with my account locked, our Union group was without anyone at the helm. No-one could post, no-one could join. Terribly sad to see, considering the huge level of support both overt and tacit from almost 150 of the job groups I post on, not that this would stop us. However after 24hrs, the review on my account was lifted with no further warning or words from Facebook. A site to behold. What is even more amazing is that officially Facebook states it will take between 48 hours to 45 days to review an account! With Covid, I was notified that if it wasn't reviewed in 30 days, then it would never be reviewed at all. However, despite this, Facebook reviewed and unlocked my account in 24 hours! It is up to speculation, but I believe that whomever administered the review, weighed up the case for and against locking my account and decided, with rapid process, that the case for restricting the account was without any substance.\n\nWith this said, Our Union of People, Under One Movement and One Goal, is here to ensure and preserve the integrity of the rates and values of trades, to prevent the manipulation of the very structures that formulate this economy against us, to ensure transparency and honesty between all parties in the supply chain and to ban/regulate these crooked Umbrella companies that seek to dissect, undermine, breakdown and deduct up to more than 25% extra from, workers pay.\nWe are here to stay, say \"no\" to Umbrella PAYE, sign and share our petition here: https://bit.ly/3nnGMVl and join our movement: https://bit.ly/3tzd1mK.\nTom #notoumbrellapaye"}, {"ner": "PS685 PER THOUSAND. 16 on 100mm bkls 1.30 on foundations blks immediate start for right gangs Flaxley Rd, Selby YO8 4D.

We have expanded greatly in the past week, with our word being spread across 150 groups, and myself been granted the honour of moderating not 1, not 2 but 3 job groups.

Nothing more terrifying I imagine.\nWe have almost set up all of our online avenues of media so we can consolidate our power base and begin co-ordinated confrontations against unprofessional agencies, payrolls and umbrellas through miraculous data capture apps and software's which will allow us to catch these individuals in their lies and deception and enable us to hold them to a standard which no-one else has for a very long time.\nWe have also began making headway with contacting MPs who will investigate these Umbrella companies and bring to light, the stain that they are on this industry and indeed, on any other industry.\nIf what you have read so far sounds good, and you want to see Umbrella be ripped from this industry like the weed it is, then sign and share our petition here: https://bit.ly/3nnGMVl and join the UK Construction Workers Union fb group here: https://bit.ly/3tzd1mK.\nOur Union of People, Under One Movement and One Goal is here, finally, to provide a voice for the worker, to restore integrity and value to trades and their rates, to cut the fat from the recruiting agency market and to remove Umbrella companies/processes once and for all.\nThank you\nTom Finnis\n#notoumbrellapaye"}, {"ner": "Nicole Caval is with Alana Cameron.\n3 June at 10:42 *\n\nCaval are looking for groundworkers to do Kerb Laying for a project in Rosyth.\n\nMust have kerb laying experience and hold a valid CSCS card.\n\nWork starts immediately for 5/6 weeks.\n\nPS18/hr CIS with a great overtime package.\n\nCandidates must have relevant experience and be able to provide a reference.\n\nCall the office 0141 732 9660 or Alana 07917900647 / Nicole 07917900643 to apply!"}, {"ner": "Nicole Caval is with Alana Cameron.\n3 June at 10:42 *\n\nCaval are looking for groundworkers to do Kerb Laying for a project in Rosyth.\n\nMust have kerb laying experience and hold a valid CSCS card.\n\nWork starts immediately for 5/6 weeks.\n\nPS18/hr CIS with a great overtime package.\n\nCandidates must have relevant experience and be able to provide a reference.\n\nCall the office 0141 732 9660 or Alana 07917900647 / Nicole 07917900643 to apply!"}, {"ner": "Alana Cameron\n3 June at 09:14 *\n\nCaval require an ADT Op for a large project in Middleborough\nWork starts immediately.\nIt will be a large muck shift job moving a large stock pile.\nCandidates must have Blue CPCS or NPORS with CSCS logo.\nPS17/hr CIS\nOnsite parking\nGREAT overtime package\n50-70 hours per week.\nNO DIGS\nIf interested please call the office 0141 732 9660.
